# Portfolio
Howdy! I'm Lucas Foxworthy. I mainly program for games but also focus on implementing and designing UI for games. 
I am a Computer Science and Game Programming Major from University of Advancing Technologies.

This is currently a work in progress as I need to work on tranferring my old portfolio design I did online over to HTML/CSS/JS files
