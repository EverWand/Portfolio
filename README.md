# Portfolio
This will be a portfolio website that I will be building to show off what I have created and to show off my passions and ambitions


I am Lucas Foxworthy and I am currently a first-year student at University of Advancing Technology. 
My current major is computer science, however I also share passion in game development and VR

After a class were I made my final a website for my the start of my online portfolio, 
and now I continue to update it when another assignment calls for it or when I want to put on 
something I am proud to show off or want to consider adjusting some design stuff.
