                <p id="bio_p">
                    Born in Oroville, California. Grown up in North Bend, Oregon. My journey continues in Arizona. Ever since I was five years old, I had pinned the goal of becoming a game developer. Growing up, I have kept this in the forefront of my ambitions and have discovered a liking towards programming, taking classes since middle school. I became a Computer Science and Game Programmer Major at University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, AZ. There I really began launching my skills in the direction of game development, learning techniques with different programming languages, how to work inside game engines, and most importantly, working on my leadership and collaboration with teams. During my time in college I joined a startup studio by the name of Borogoi Games that helped me take my career more seriously and work on projects that weren’t just for personal or school reasons. I learned while working on teams that I really enjoy UI and have taken the role many times of designing and/or implementing different styles of UI for projects. I have always valued a good work ethic and strive to find enjoyment and to do my best on the projects that I participate in.
