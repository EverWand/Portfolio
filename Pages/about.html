                <p id="bio_p">
                    I’ve been fascinated by video games for as long as I can remember. At age five, I realized the games I loved were created by others, sparking my drive to pursue game development. Growing up, I immersed myself in gaming by playing a variety of titles and collecting consoles, old and new. My passion expanded to development as I explored different disciplines, discovering a strong affinity for programming and software creation. 
                    I began learning programming fundamentals in middle and high school, even gaining my first experience with game engines. In college, I honed my skills further through computer science and game programming studies, while learning from and collaborating with peers and communities. Over time, I developed a particular interest in UI/UX design, a discipline I’ve been growing alongside my programming expertise.
