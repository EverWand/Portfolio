                <p>Although the SIP was originally conceptualized as a browser extension, I opted for the familiarity of the Unity Game engine, and because it would also help me meet requirements for another class. I Created my repository on Github and got to work on structuring the project. During the little time I had to create the prototype, I grey-boxed the interface panels and elements. Although the functionality of the prototype was very rough and mainly focused on showing off the focus point of the innovation claim, being the rewarding of more accurate estimates of a taskâ€™s completion time.
