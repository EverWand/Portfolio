                        <p id= "ProjectDesc">
                            Rust became a very unique challenge for me as this project forced me to really concentrate and learn a new way other than OOP principles to program efficient code. Rust instead utilized the Component Entity System principles. For the whole class that we spent learning Rust, I opted for alternative assignments where I focused on trying to learn the intricacies of Rust and ECS by creating a game, using the Bevy engine. Bevy became another pillar as the engine wasn’t a traditional game engine like Godot or Unreal as there was no editor interfacing. I had to research, design, and build a game from scratch using a completely foreign engine, language, and even principles. But in the end, I was able to get more comfortable with the tools I was given and was able to create multiple systems for the game.

                        <p id= "ProjectDesc">While I was a part of Production Studio, I had joined The Cursed Men team to help with implementing UI for the game. I also did some technical art and was also later promoted to being the Program Lead. As a programmer also doing UI and technical art, I was focused on implementing what our UI designer envisioned for the game and making things modular and hooked up to the game’s mechanics. For Technical art, I created shaders and modified textures to help add some more interest and life into the environment.

The user was able to interface with the application in order to make their own RPG character inspired by Dungeons and Dragons character creation. When the User was done rolling and assigning their stats, the application would then either save or create a file of that character and its information. Going back or re-opening the application would have it display the list of saved characters so that way the user can access and edit them later.</p>

                            Fight and Flight was created for Game-A-Week. Instead of doing a short single player demo, the theme, “Birds with Arms” really made me want to see some birds punch one another. I designed the game to be a local multiplayer fighting game. I integrated controller-support so each player can duke it out on their own controller. You could alternatively also play on the keyboard.

I have constructed both a Gnome Sort and a Tim Sort algorithm that takes in randomly generated lists of values. I ran tests to see just how fast each sorting algorithm was when processing each list. With Tim Sort incorporating both the Insertion Sort and Merge Sort algorithms, I was able to gather more insight than just the two algorithms I began my focus on. In an API document detailing the program and test results, I graphed both the Worst-Case time complexities for the two algorithms to see how they compared with the results I had gathered.</p>

                        <p id= "ProjectDesc">During the creation of Bee Keeps, I had implemented architecture to be very modular. I needed this modularity because I wanted to design multiple types of bees with their own distinct traits about them, but to spawn and behave in similar ways. The bees were designed and implemented to be spawned in as random types near their hives and we were given the structure of basic AI behavior to chase down and charge at the player. The whole point of the game is about making a profit for the day and upgrading yourself so you can survive longer days. That being said, Modularity really helped with making the upgrade system as the player could be easily modified to boost stats.

                        <p id= "ProjectDesc">The main issue from this Procedural Generation program was in fact not the procedural generation. Rather, the issue that took a lot of planning and testing was how to implement a first-person navigation system inside of a program meant for basic GUI Forms. I had to figure out how to translate the player’s directional inputs into which room to move into based on their orientation. And because the program had no way of creating 3D environments, I had to open up blender and take images of every type of room from the angles the player could potentially be view the room from, then import those images into the files, then not only get it to know what type of room to display, but at what perspective based on the player’s orientation and the way they entered. At the time it was a major headache to wrap my head around with a short deadline, but the efforts showed a result of a fully functional procedural dungeon that the player can experience in first person through a forms application.

                        <p id= "ProjectDesc">Skyables was one of the first completed prototypes I created within the unreal engine, which came with lots of learning and solving many issues. One of these issues was needing to figure out a way for the user to better find the collectable items that were needed to beat the level and use for the shop. I decided to create my first ever world-space UI with an arrow that served as a compass, pointing towards a collectible that the player was near so that they knew where they were meant to go. The other big challenge I had faced was the teleporting transitions. The intended result was to make the player think the character was traveling as an orb across different teleporter zones, but it was actually a lot of game developer magic. I implemented the teleporters with the ability to link up together as a linked list system, which made the spawned orb know what teleporter to travel too. During travel, the player character is still at the first teleporter, both invincible to damage and invisible. Meanwhile, the camera would swap over to the orb to give the player the feel that they’re traveling with the orb. After arriving at the end destination, the player character is positioned at the new teleporter and re-enabled for the player  </p>

                        <p id= "ProjectDesc">Bleak Manor was created when I was doing the Game-A-Week course. This Game was more unique than the other games we produced during the class as we all got to work together as a team to create content for the AR board, Tilt5. The game was a 3-player asymmetric ghost hunting game that projected from the board for the players wearing the Tilt5’s glasses, allowing the user’s to see their own perspectives while looking at the same board. Two players took the role as ghost hunters that wandered Bleak Manor through a third-person perspective while the third player tried to hide around the manor as a ghost in order not be caught, seeing the environment in a top-down perspective. We used the AR projections to give the game depth so that the players felt like they were moving around in a 3D space and the ghost got to see the world popping out towards them as they could look over walls and have a bird's-eye-view for any hiding places or nearby hunters.</p>

                        <!--DESCRIPTION-->
                        <p id= "ProjectDesc">I tried to use a different kind of game engine than what you'd expect. Bevy is a game engine which utilizes the Rust programming language. There are bountiful amounts of differences on how you would make a game using Bevy. The two main significances are how there’s no interface for the engine, so everything must be done inside of an IDE through documents. The second and what was the more difficult thing to wrap my mind around at the time was how Bevy doesn’t use Object Oriented Programming Principles (OOP) you’d likely see for most game engines and languages. Instead, Bevy opted for the principles called the Entity-Component System (ECS), taking advantage of how you’d structure code within Rust. To understand the basics of Bevy and this different style of engine, I made a simple Pong game using entities, components, and queries to make a movement controller, collision, and bouncing logic from scratch.</p>

                        <p id= "ProjectDesc">The Cursed Men was one of the first larger teams I’ve been on, consisting of around fifteen other developers who put their efforts towards the project, all with their own wealth of knowledge and hard work when it came to their specific principles and roles on the team. I imagine myself no different, stepping up with my experience leading small teams prior to the project, I became the person in charge of implementing the UI and the lead programmer. We would have two meetings a week where we discussed our stand-ups and how to tackle problems. One of these meetings would be to make a build of where the project’s progress was so we can analyze where we were at and what possibly needed to be fixed or changed. This build-review provided an outlet to not only be critical about what needed to happen, but served as a way to celebrate our efforts and see the project grow each week. I would often be on stand-by to provide help and ensure we made progress for each week’s build, while also handling my own UI tasks.
